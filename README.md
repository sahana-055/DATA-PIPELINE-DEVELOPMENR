# DATA-PIPELINE-DEVELOPMENR
Data pipeline development is the process of designing and building automated systems that move data from various sources to a final destination where it can be stored, analyzed, or used for machine learning. These pipelines play a vital role in modern data-driven applications by ensuring a continuous and reliable flow of data. A typical data pipeline includes several key stages such as data ingestion, where raw data is collected from different sources like databases, APIs, sensors, or cloud storage. This data then goes through preprocessing steps like cleaning, filtering, and validation to ensure consistency and accuracy. After that, the data is transformed into a structured format, which may involve normalization, aggregation, or encoding. The processed data is then stored in a target system such as a data warehouse, data lake, or a relational database. Depending on the use case, pipelines can be either batch-oriented, where data is processed in chunks, or real-time, which processes data continuously. Effective data pipeline development improves the efficiency of data analysis, enhances decision-making, and supports scalable business intelligence solutions. Tools like Apache Kafka, Apache Spark, Airflow, and cloud services are commonly used for building robust and scalable pipelines that can handle large volumes of data across different platforms
